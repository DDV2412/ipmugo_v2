      abstract:
        "This paper deals with the synthesis of a speed control strategy for a five-phase permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drive based on backstepping controller. The proposed control strategy considers the nonlinearities of the system in the control law. The stability of the backstepping control strategy is proved by the Lyapunov theory. Simulated results are provided to verify the feasibility of the backstepping control strategy.",

                abstract:
                  "Security problems in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) have been researched from more than a decade. There are various security approaches being evolving towards resisting various forms of attack using different methodologies. After reviewing the existing security approaches, it can be concluded that such security approaches are highly attack-specific and doesnt address various associated issues in WSN. It is essential for security approach to be computationally lightweight. Therefore, this paper presents a novel analytical modelling that is based on n-tier approach with a target to generate an optimized secret key that could ensure higher degree of security during the process of data aggregation in WSN. The study outcome shows that proposed system is computationally lightweight with good performance on reduced delay and reduced energy consumption. It also exhibits enhanced response time and good data delivery performance to balance the need of security and data forwarding performance in WSN.",
